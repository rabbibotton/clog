The value of local storage persists in the browser cache even after the browser
is closed. If you reset this page the session storage key will remain the same,
but opening this page in another window or tab will be a new session. If the
new window came from a click from this window, the session keys (on some
browsers are copied first to the new window, if you wish to persist data accross
windows use local storage instead.</p>
