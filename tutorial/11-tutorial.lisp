;;; Creating code GUIs from scratch is great, but in the real world often design
;;; is left to artists and code is left to engineers. CLOG is an amazing solution
;;; for that model of app development. Any existing web page can become a CLOG
;;; app by simply adding the following two lines to an existing HTML file:
;;;
;;;      <script src="/js/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
;;;      <script src="/js/boot.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
;;;
;;; The first line adds jquery which CLOG uses to enhance browser compatability.
;;; The second line adds the CLOG "boot" file.
;;;
;;; For this tutorial we generated the clog/static-files/tutorial/tut-11.html
;;; by using the form generator at https://bootsnipp.com/forms?version=3
;;; then used the the template from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/
;;; and added CLOG's boot.js script line. It was neccesary to add an id to the
;;; form (id='form1') as the generator did not add one.
;;;
;;; In the code below:
;;;
;;;  - We set a blank on-submit to overide the behavior in the bootstrap
;;;          buttons to submit the form HTML style.
;;;  - We are going to attach to the "Good Button" an on-click handler
;;;          to handle getting the values
;;;  - We attach to each control in the on-click handler that we want
;;;          a value for and query them
;;;  - We attach an on-click handler that resets the form to the
;;;          "Scary Button"
;;;
;;;  We go in the browser to the file
;;;          "http://127.0.0.1:8080/tutorial/tut-11.html"
